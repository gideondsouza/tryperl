TryPerl
=======

TryPerl is a cloud IDE for Perl. It's still a feeble attempt at a Perl cloud IDE. More like a Perl Notepad. It asks to login via Github and each perl script created in TryPerl is a _Gist_ on your github account.

This is what it looks like:

I did however, make it work in the past with FreeBSD jails, Linux Containers and other crazy things but (like you guessed)
there were security holes and I couldn't fix them.

I plan to use Docker to make this work. [Here is](http://stackoverflow.com/q/14861478/368070) post on stackoverflow where I tried to ask about it. 

If you think you can help, please email me at gideon at cpan dot org or add an answer to the stackoverflow post.
