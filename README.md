TryPerl
=======

TryPerl is a cloud IDE for Perl. It's still a long standing work in progress.

Check it out live : http://www.tryperl.com

Currently it doesn't execute code. (I know this seems very pointless). 

I did however, make it work in the past with FreeBSD jails, Linux Containers and other crazy things but (like you guessed)
there were security holes and I couldn't fix them.

I'm not giving up though, I'm learning something new everyday and hopefully in sometime I will have enough expertise 
to write  a debugger/tracer _executor_ program that will use [ptrace](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptrace) to inspect and 
run a program and shut down anything malicous.

If you think you can help, please email me at gideon at cpan dot org
